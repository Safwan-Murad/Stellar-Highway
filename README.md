##About##
Welcome to Stellar Highway.... the open source repository!
Stellar Highway is a 2D endless runner devepeloped by me (Safwan Murad) and released on the google play store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.stellarstones.sh)
Stellar Highway is a passion project that wasn't built to make money so as a big fan of open source and as a believer in the GPL license it was only right to release the game open source

##Technical Requirements##
You only need to install Godot 4.5.1 and you are set

##The Message##
The game's code is under the GPL license so you are free to do whatever you want with the code but as the game's developer I just want to say: 
- If you wanna use my game as a template for your project, please don't create gambling systems or lootboxes in your project as microtransactions (I can't stop you if you do it, but please don't)
- If the game's code or assets helped you with your project, a mention of me or a link to this repository would be sincerely appreciated
- Please don't rerelease the game without changing anything
- If you wanna support me, just download the game from the google play store lmao
